            <p>This guy is cool as FUCK <br>Not only is he a big fucking guy, he also has a canon form.
             <br> That's right- a CANNON. <br> LOOK AT THIS SHIT.</p>
        </div>
        <img src="Images/Golurk but CANNON.png" width="300px" alt="CANNON GOLURK?!">
        <p>Wouldn't want to walk into a room and be greeted with this motherfucker now would we?</p>
        <br>
        <p>His sick fucking design aside- let's talk viability.</p>
        <p>
            Taking a look at this absolute UNIT's typing, Ground/Ghost is really interesting. <br>
            It's Ground type gives it an immunity to Electric type attacks, while it's Ghost type give it an immunity to both Normal- and Fighting type attacks-  <br> including the move Fake out, which makes it flinch 100% of the time (But can only be used the very first turn a mon is sent out). <br>
            Aside from the THREE immunities (3 is outrageous btw), Golurk also has a quad resistance in Poison type aswell as regular resistances in Bug and Rock. <br>
            What we know so far is that it's typing is incredible and that it looks sick as fuck. <br> Next let's take a look at his stats. Golurk has one stat that really sticks out
            being it's Physical Attack stat. <br> 124 is VERY good, escpecially for a non-legendary pokémon like itself. <br>
            The only problem is that Golurk has a base stat total of 483. Some might not notice a problem here, but you gotta understand that pokémon have 6 stats in total. <br>
            Those being HP, Physical Attack, Physical Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. <br>
            Golurk having 124 base stat points into Physical Attack means that almost a FOURTH of his stat total was pumped into one out of six stats. <br>
            This means that even though both of his defensive stats are at a respectable 80 and his HP at an OK 89,<br>
            it has the incredibly awkward speed stat of 55. This is bad. very bad. Even worse than a speed stat of 1. <br>
            The reason for this is that in most cases it's too slow to outspeed anything else on the playing field, <br> causing it to be killed by a strong super effective move before Golurk can make a move himself <br>
            Now if you know anything about pokémon, you might be thinking of a way to make Golurk move before any other mons on the field,<br> even though it's speed stat is so low.
            What I'm talking about here is the move Trick Room, which reverses the move order of all the mons on the field. <br>
            In short, Trick Rooms causes slower pokémon to move first, and fast ones to move last. <br>
            HOWEVER- I said 55 points into it's speed was incredibly awkward. The reason for this is the following. <br>
            Most teams built around the move Trick Room are equipped with incredibly slow pokémon, even SLOWER than Golurk. <br>
            The reason why I say 55 speed is awkward, is because it's too slow to function outside of Trick Room, but too FAST to function INSIDE of Trick Room. <br>
            Most mons used in Trick Room teams have speed stats below 50,<br>
            As an example, Amoonguss (haha amongus) is a very annoying pokémon capable of putting your mons to sleep with a speed stat of 30, which is lower than Golurk's 55, <br>
            but inside of Trick Room, it all of a sudden gets to move before Golurk, rendering Golurk completely useless.
            <br> 
            If anything can save this big motherfucker, it'd be that they took points out of his horrid Special Attack stat,<br> which is also 55- but isn't as big of a deal since most pokemon only need one usable attack stat, and gave some of those points into his speed. <br>
            (Or take points out of his speed and pump even more into his Physical Attack so he becomes a Trick Room DEMON :3) <br> (Might become one of the most broken mons in the franchise that way though)
            <br> One thing we haven't talked about when it comes to the big cannon guy is it's abilities. <br> Simply put, they don't make a difference. At all. <br>
            It's first ability Iron Fists powers up the damage of all punching moves, which WOULD be great on top of it's high Physical Attack- <br>
            if it wasn't for Golurk getting removed from the playing field before it get;s to attack due to it's annoying speed stat. <br>
            It's second ability is Klutz, which makes it so Golurk can't hold items. This is fucking worthless. <br>
            It's final- and secret ability (which is very rare to get), No Guard, makes it so every attack use BY and ON the user will ALWAYS connect, no matter what. <br>
            This also SUCKS as it just makes it so powerful moves like Hydro Pump, which aren't normaly 100% accurate, will always hit our Golurk and kill it in a single hit.
